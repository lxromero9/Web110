            <p>Maximilian Maria Kolbe, born Raymond Kolbe, from an early age demonstrated the strong amount of faith that he had. He claims to have
                been visited by our Blessed Mother. She, in the vision, offered young raymond two crowns. One white signifying purity, and the other red. The red 
                one he realized signified martyrdom. He claims to have accepted both of them. As he grew older he joined the religous order of the Fransicans. 
                There he changed and adopted the name Maximilian Maria. During this time he founded a printing business, which he used to evangelize. However, in the background of all of 
                this, another man was rising in power in the country of Germany.

            <h2 class="titlecol">The Encounter - Auschwitz</h2>
            <img src="kolbe1.png" alt="Saint Kolbe Camp">
            <p>Adolf Hitler began his invasion into the country of Poland. Capturing millions of polish jews, among them, Father Kolbe. Kolbe, had been, due to his time period in which
                he was born into, spreading anti-semitic lies. Here we see how even saints commit sin but they do not let this define them and keep them ignorant. Father Kolbe would begin
                to hide jews in his home. He would come to realize that they were all his brothers and sisters. Kolbe eventually was captured and tortured and sent to Auschwitz. There he 
                would face evil incarnate and offer himself for another. The encounter began when many were being sent to death. When one man pleaded with the Nazi's to spare him due to
                him having a family, Kolbe stepped up and offered his life for his. Claiming he had no family and was offering his so that the man would be spared. Kolbe was 
                murdered shortly thereafter. Kolbe offered the greatest gift a man could offer his brother. His life. With this he teaches us that we must do what we can to help others.
                Maybe we aren't called to martyrdom but small sacrifices offered up to those less fortunate. He teaches us that even with our imperfection and ignorance, through Christ,
                we can do incredible deeds.
