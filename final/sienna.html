            <img src="sienna.jpg" alt="Saint Catherine of Sienna">
            <p>St. Catherine of Siena was born during the outbreak of the plague in Siena, Italy on March 25, 1347. At the 
               age of 16 her sister died, leaving her husband as a widower. Catherine's parents proposed that she replaced 
               her sister as wife, but she strongly opposed this. She began fasting and cut her hair short to mar her appearance. 
               She then joined the Third Order of St. Dominic, in which she did not have to join a convent but could live among 
               society and practice the faith. At the age of 21 she described having a mystical experience in which she had a mystical
               marriage to Christ. After this, her holiness increased and she went on to become the first woman doctor of the Church.

            <img src="exorcist.jpg" alt="Saint Catherine praying over possesed person">
            <p>St. Catherine came face to face many times with the enemy. She was spiritually strong enough to be able to pray over
               many possesed people and free them. She even began to give the devil a nickname: "pickpocket." As she said that the devil was 
               trying to pickpocket many souls. She was a brave soul who even at the moment of her death, battled many evil spirits
               trying to make her fear. But she continued to pray and ask God for mercy. She even told those around her to forgive her
               for not caring about their salvation more. At the moment of her death, her face expressed joy. And her body remained 
               uncorrupted until she was laid to rest.
