            <p>A Saint is a person in heaven, (officially recognized by the church or not),
               who lived a heroically virtous life, offered their life for others, or were martyred for the faith.
               There are 3 steps a person must pass to be offically delcared a Saint and recognized by the universal church.
               The title is formally given to a person once canonized by the Church as sharing eternal life with God. They are
               humans who we should look up to and try to imitate as best we can!

            <h2 class="title">Demons</h2>
            <img src="thefall.jpg" alt="The fall of the angel Lucifer">
            <p>The term demon comes from the Greek word daim≈çn, which means "supernatural being' or "spirit". Demons are fallen 
               angels, who are evil spirits. They are angels who oppose God's will, are under Satan's control and are hostile toward
               humans. They especially enjoy tempting and at times visually appearing to many Saints throughout history to steer
               them off the path of God. People with strong faith are the ones they love to attack as these can bring more people 
               to God. They are known to manifest through many forms, sometimes visual but not all the time. 
               Nonetheless, one should never fear demons as they have already been defeated and have no true power. As these Saints prove!

            <h2 class="title">Significance</h2>
            <img src="flower.jpg" alt="Little Flower hurting demon">
            <p>As we will learn from these brave souls, who lived extraordinary lives, demons are not something to be afraid
               of if we have God in our lives. Their strong faith helped them overcome these manifestations and show us that we can 
               also deal with our life's problems. They bravely faced off against these manifestations and instead of growing in fear
               they grew closer to the Lord. Making the demons more upset at their failure. Let us then anger the demons by living holy lives.
